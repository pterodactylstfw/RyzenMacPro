# RyzenMacPro
This is my EFI for the AMD Ryzen 5 3600X @ AMD Radeon 5600XT 16 GB RAM setup.

I managed to make it work really good, after many tries. I think that you can start doing your own Ryzentosh by looking at these files. You can't really use them, because they are signed for my PC ( Secure Boot ).
The PC's specs are:
<p>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X 3.8 GHz</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX</p>
<p>RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16 GB 3200 MHz</p>
<p>GPU: MSI Radeon 5600 XT MECH OC 6 GB VRAM</p>
<p>SSD used for macOS: ADATA SU650 480 GB</p>
<p>SSD used for Windows 11: Kingston NV2 M.2 250 GB</p>

<p>I use macOS Sonoma 14 right now, and I usually upgrade right when a new update appears.</p>
<p>Also, the Mac I am emulating is The Mac Pro 2019 with the Intel Chip (MacPro7,1).</p>

Issues in macOS:
<ul>
  <li>Nothing right now.</li>
</ul>

Issues in Windows 11:
<ul>
  <li>Fast Startup must be turned off so the PC can shut down properly;</li>
  <li>Motherboard seen as MacPro 7,1, can be solved through the config.plist, but not a problem for me.</li>
</ul>
