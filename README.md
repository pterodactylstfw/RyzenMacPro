This is my EFI for the AMD Ryzen 5 3600X @ AMD Radeon 5600XT 16 GB RAM setup.

I managed to make it to work really good, after many tries. I think that it's a really good starting point to look at this files. You can't really use them, because they are signed for my PC ( Secure Boot ).
The PC's specs are:
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600X 3.8 GHz
Motherboard: MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 16 GB 3200 MHz
GPU: MSI Radeon 5600 XT MECH OC 6 GB VRAM
SSD used for macOS: ADATA SU650 480 GB
SSD used for Windows 11: Kingston NV2 M.2 250 GB

Issues in macOS:
-nothing right now.

Issues in Windows 11:
-Fast Startup must be turned off so the PC can shut down properly;
-Motherboard seen as MacPro 7,1, can be solved through the config.plist, but not a problem for me.
